# regularised-linear-regression-
This is a repository for the implementation of regularized linear regression algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm is to fit a linear regression model to a dataset with a regularization term in order to prevent overfitting.

The repository contains the following files:

regularized_linear_regression.py: This file contains the implementation of the regularized linear regression algorithm using L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) and L1 regularization (Lasso Regression).

README.md: This file contains the information about the repository.

requirements.txt: This file contains the required dependencies for running the code.

Dependencies
The code is written in Python 3.8 and requires the following dependencies:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
